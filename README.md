wordpress-mover
===============

Quickly and easily move your existing Wordpress installation to a new directory or domain.

Instructions
============
1. Upload wp-mover.php to your WordPress root. (Actually, you can put this file anywhere on your server, but it’ll auto-load your database config info if it’s in the WP root).
2. Navigate to the URL where you installed wp-mover.php and ensure all the fields are filled in.
3. Click “Run Mover” and a few seconds later, you’re done!

4. You definitely want to to remove the script (or at least disable all permissions on it) when you're finished. If not, dirty hackers and other nefarious individuals will have access to your Wordpress database credentials and will probably wreak unrestrained havoc!
